## Scalability Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Single Node Architecture**
   - No built-in horizontal scaling
   - Process-based concurrency model
   - Shared SQLite database

2. **Vector Database**
   - ChromaDB suitable for <1M vectors
   - Linear search performance degradation
   - No distributed query support

3. **Embedding Throughput**
   - CPU-bound processing
   - No GPU acceleration in native mode
   - Sequential document processing

### Scale-Up Strategies

1. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Increase CPU cores for parallel embedding
   - Add RAM for larger model caching
   - SSD storage for faster I/O

2. **Horizontal Scaling Options**
   - Deploy multiple instances with workspace sharding
   - Use external embedding services for throughput
   - Implement queue-based document processing

3. **Enterprise Enhancements**
